# Daily Coding Challenge 2022-12-30

## Prompt:
Implement 3 stacks using a single list:
```
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.list = []

    def pop(self, stack_number):
        pass

    def push(self, item, stack_number):
        pass
```
I also realised this code would work for n stacks so it is implemented that way
